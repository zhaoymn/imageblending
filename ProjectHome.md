# Project summary #
This project implemented an algorithm for image blending. For now, I followed the paper "Poisson Image Editing" (SIGGRAPH 2003). The algorithm is written in MATLAB, the GUI is implemented in C#.

**The project is in alpha stage, so there still might be bugs in the code.**
# Project information #
This project is derived from course csci1950-g @ Brown University.
For more information, please visit the course page [Project 2: Image Blending ](http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1950-g/asgn/proj2/)

The code is presented by _YIJIA **XU**_ @ Shanghai University of Engineering Science, who is now working at Shanghai Automobile Gear Works (SAGW in short).

Have fun with my codes.

The kernel blending code in MATLAB can be downloaded [here](http://code.google.com/p/imageblending/downloads/detail?name=kernel%200.0.1.zip).

if you want to know how to run the MATLAB code individually, see the [wiki page here](http://code.google.com/p/imageblending/wiki/Kernel).

This code is inherited from Howard Zhou @ Georgia Institute of Technology and Tommer Leyvand @ Tel-Aviv University.
Their open source code gave me a lot of help. Many thanks to them.
